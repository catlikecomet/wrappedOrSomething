stuff needed 
npm install -g expo-cli <- installing expo
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
npm install lottie-react-native (for ios i think npx pod-install is also needed) <- access to lottie anims and graphics
if using expo which this is -> expo install lottie-react-native
npm install react-native-svg <- can be used for svg graphics and drawing shapes/ animating them but i haven't tried this yet so idk how it works

I wanted to try motion sensor based stuff to look more interactive/ 3d motion like 3d images but i didn't have time, i believe npm install react-native-sensors can be used (i think there's an expo equiv instead also)
